    <p class="paragraph">The <b>2022 NFL Draft</b> kicked off on Thursday April 28th at 7pm in Las Vegas, Nevada. This class was filled with some questionable picks, and left some fans confused by their Front Office's decision. The draft will resume Friday April 29th at 6pm, with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on the clock with pick 33.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">The first round offered us some excitement when the Detriot Lions traded up from pick 32 to pick 12, and drafted Jameson Williams. It also provided some questionable calls, such as the New England Patriots decision to draft Cole Strange with pick 29. Many believe the Eagles made the most out of their first round picks by trading away draft picks 18 and 102 for AJ Brown.</p>
